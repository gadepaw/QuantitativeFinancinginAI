This project aims to replicate and expand upon a deep learning-based approach for predicting the directional movement of financial assets. The paper in question is “Artificial Intelligence in Quantitative Finance: Leveraging Deep Learning for Smarter Portfolio Management and Asset Allocation,”  Olanrewaju et al. In the paper, the authors use deep learning techniques like LSTM and Transformers to predict the returns and create a portfolio management based on that.  Using engineered financial features and multiple models — including XGBoost, MLP, LSTM, and Transformer — we evaluate model performance in forecasting whether asset prices will rise or fall over a 5-day horizon
